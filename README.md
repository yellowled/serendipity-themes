# Serendipity themes

This repository is a storage unit. It contains themes I created for the [Serendipity](http://s9y.org) blog system. This repository is unmaintained, and it will stay that way. I do not accept pull requests, issues or questions about these themes. They are just here for documentation purposes, I guess.

## Note for Serendipity users

Instead of even considering themes from this repository for your blog, please choose a theme bundled with the Serendipity core or available on [Spartacus](http://spartacus.s9y.org) instead. The themes in this repository are old and will never be updated again.
