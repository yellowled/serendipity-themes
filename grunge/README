Just some notes on the 'Grunge' template, which is sort of special in
some ways:

1. This template has only one sidebar - at least it appears that
   way. Actually, it has two sidebars, but they are put into one. That
   means you can actually assign sidebar plugins to both sidebars, but
   this will only affect the order in which they are displayed. The
   left sidebar will be displayed first.

   This is a means of compatibility. This way, you can keep your
   existing 'arrangement' of sidebar plugins if you were using a
   3-column template before.

2. This template has no configuration options for the new s9y theme
   configurator, which will be introduced in v1.1 of s9y. I'm not
   planning on implementing any, since I want to keep this template
   very simple.

   The one feature of the template which is really affected by this is
   the little navbar at the top. The links 'Index', 'RSS', and 'Login'
   should work right out of the box in any blog. The links 'Email'
   should work if you're using the s9y contactform plugin and used the
   default permalink for your contact form.

   If you chose to change the contact form permalink or want to use a
   different contact form (or a 'mailto:' link), you'll have to edit
   the index.tpl of this template to suit your needs.
